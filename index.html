		<h2>Projects & Skills</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>jovarkos.org - Grew a small community comprised of technically-inclined teenagers
				to grow personal Linux & computing skills. Built software for and configured infrastructure to build and
				maintain a distributable installation image. We described it as: <br>
				<i>"A GNU/Linux distribution based on Arch Linux with the goal of striving towards a out of box
					experience the Linux desktop has never seen before." <br></i>
				<b>Skills:</b> <i>Linux development, Bash, git, web design and hosting, devops, community management.</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				bsarmy.com - Built site to help soldiers view & share resources while connecting to their community. The
				platform was designed around a LAMP stack and utilized Bootstrap for the UI. It integrated Twilio Verify
				for password-less login, Cloudflare Tunnels as a reverse proxy, Tailscale for secure access, and ntfy
				for realtime chat and notifications. More features were planned, but the project was dropped due to lack 
				of interest by leadership.
				<br>
				Although it didn't gain traction, those who used the platform found it valuable for connecting with
				others and accessing resources, and it sparked initiatives such as a trash pickup drive (40 gal/day avg.
				collected!) and Dining Facility schedule collection repo.
				<b>Skills:</b> <i>Linux Administration, git, web design and UX, MySQL DB design, networking, community outreach.</i>
