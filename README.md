# Hey there!

My name is Lucas Burlingham. You've stumbled upon my resume on the web, and hopefully you're one of two people:

## 1. A recruiter or technical lead looking to hire.

   Odds are, *I'm ready to be hired*. Let's take a look at the summary lines of my resume together:

   > Trusted System Administrator with 5+ years of technical experience supporting 1300 users globally.

   You're going to ask for references. I'd be willing to bet they already trust me and am happy to hear that I'm being looked at for a position.

   > Able to lead technical initiatives and deliver solutions in classified settings.

   Not many people boast about taking on extra work to improve their environment, but don't worry, I have boundries too. A classified setting to me means a TSCIF, not just the Coca Cola recipe.

   > Holds a current TS/SCI clearance and CompTIA A+, Security+ and Akamai Cloud Computing Foundations certifications.

   That's right. I'm ready to start working now, not in 3 months or after my clearance goes through.

   > Qualified as a DoD 8140 administrator.
   
   It was required for my job in the Army. I'll keep it going for you too. 

## 2. Someone looking to improve their resume or have some feedback about mine. 

I've had my resume reviewed by DoL councilors and people in the business of hiring. They seem to think it's good, and I've taken their suggestions. 

Have some feedback? Submit an issue or pull request!
